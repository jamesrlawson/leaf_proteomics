../licor_data_canon2.csv was created manually with the help of licor_samples.R

The challenge was to find the appropriate sample numbers associated with the licor data, using the licor remarks as a guide. A number of issues with field species identifications and dating had to be clarified. Area adjustments were then made to the licor spreadsheet on the basis of leaf scans.

The files within this folder contain a record of this process. 

See sheets within DP14_licorData_combined_JL_161026.xslx for data with associated licor equations.
